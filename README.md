# Full Stack Application Project

## Sweet Pea Farm Business Webpage

The Sweet Pea app functions as a single page application using HTML and CSS with [Bulma](http://bulma.io/), a CSS framework. The [client side](https://github.com/itbeauregard/sweet-pea-front-end) is written in Javascript with the jQuery library and Handlebars templating. The back end is written in Ruby and I used Rails Migrations to manage SQL tables.

## Check out the page

The back end was deployed on Heroku [at this address](https://sweet-pea-farm.herokuapp.com).

The front end GitHub repository is located [here](https://github.com/itbeauregard/sweet-pea-front-end).
